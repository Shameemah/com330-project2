          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            A life spent trying to reconcile both the creative and the analytical,
            finding purpose and going unafraid.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                For many years in high school, I found myself constantly torn
                between identifying as an artist or a programmer. I was made to
                believe that it was impossible to be both creative and analytical,
                so my younger self felt the need to pick one and neglect the other.
                This became especially overwhelming for me when I had to pick a major
                for college.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                I was never quite sure what I wanted to major in for college, but
                architecture made sense to me because it allowed me to be both creative
                and analytical. However,I quickly learned in my first year of college that
                architecture did not allow me to be creative in the way I had imagined.
                I had to make the difficult decision to switch majors after being
                enrolled as an architecture student for a year.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Ultimately, I decided to switch majors to Information Technology
                and Management because I had always loved programming, and was excited
                at the thought of using technology to solve basic problems that people
                in my home country, Ghana, face on the daily.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                In the last four years, I have discovered that IT has given me the
                opportunity to combine my creative and analytical sides. College has
                been a long ride of rediscovering myself and unlearning the things
                that made me feel like I could only be one thing or the other, but
                not both. I am currently in my final semester of college, and am
                excited to start work as a Product Manager after graduation.
